# OSL_Distance_Calculator
Calculates distance traveled by the mouse in the OSL chamber as well as plotting the pathway on a graph. 

Download the file/copy paste the file onto a python program reader (I like Visual Code Studio, but I am sure other source-code editors will be feasible) 

- Be sure to download all of the python libraries needed for this program using the "pip3 install [name of library]" command in the terminal if you're using a Mac.
- Simply run the program and complete prompts it may ask such as : "Dropping your CSV file into the prompt" and "Inputting your conversion factor"
